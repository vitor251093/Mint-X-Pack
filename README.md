# Mint-X-Pack
Changes pack to use on Linux Mint when you are running it on a MacBook

Inside each one of the new files there are instructions of how/where to add them so they work correctly. In the edited files the added lines will be evident so you can edit the file and include the new lines instead of replacing it.

- autobright.sh: (New File) Automatically reduce/increase the screen bright if you remove/connect your AC adapter.
- rc.local: (Edited: /etc/rc.local) Restore the bright level when you turn your MacBook on.
- saveLastBrightLevel.sh: (New File) Save the bright level when you turn your MacBook off.
